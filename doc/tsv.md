# Exporting the Google Spreadsheet into TSV

The `colloc.php` script needs the Google spreadsheet exported as a `.tsv` file. You can use directly a local `.tsv` file or retrieve the Google spreadsheet exporting URL path. 

To get the exporting to `.tsv` URL just open the spreadsheet and select "File" > "Download as" > "Tab-spearated values (.tsv)". Your browser will download then the document. Then open the downloads manager and copy the download link from it.
