# Colloc Installation

There is only one file needed: the [`colloc.php`](https://github.com/mobilejazz/Colloc/blob/master/colloc.php) script. 

As this is a PHP script, you'll need to be able to run PHP from the command line.

- macOS: PHP comes preinstalled
- Windows: [install PHP](https://www.microsoft.com/web/platform/phponwindows.aspx) from Microsoft pages

## Running Colloc as standalone script

- Download the `colloc.php` file manually, run it from the command line (see [running Colloc](run.md))

## iOS integration

- Download the `colloc.php` file manually and add it to your project.
- Use Cocoapods to get the file:
```
pod 'Colloc', :git => 'https://github.com/mobilejazz/Colloc.git'
```
